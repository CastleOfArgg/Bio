	Add option evolving chlorophyll synthesis pathway
		which keep turning the cell green when equiped

Tail
	Add speed in expance of score, help with escaping enemy

Cell Wall
	Reduce colliding damage
	Evolving before aquire chlorophyll synthesis pathway, cell turns into Gram+ bacteria
	Evolving after aquire chlorophyll synthesis pathway, cell turns into algea, reduce mobility

Mitochondria
	Option apear after evolving tail
	Aquired after bouncing into cells without tail, and choose cohabitat instead of fighting
	Get more score after eat sugar

Emerging of sugar and other cells, and chlorophyll in some regions
Movements of other cells

Nucleus evelope
	Option aviliabal after evolving chlorophyll or mitochondria
